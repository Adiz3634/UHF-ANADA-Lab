# UHF ANADA — SCID Engine
**UHF ANADA** is a scientific framework and computational tool designed to analyze the stability of informational systems across multiple scales—from the **Planck Scale** ($10^{-35}m$) to the **Universal Scale**.

At its core, the project implements the **SCID (Self-Consistent Informational Dynamics)** theory, which treats reality as an evolving informational state ($Ψ$) governed by the drive toward equilibrium.

## The SCID Equation
The fundamental law of this system is expressed as:

$$dΨ/dτ = −∇(I(Ψ) + C(Ψ))$$

### Components:
* **$Ψ$ (Reality State):** The current informational value of the system.
* **$I(Ψ)$ (Local Instability):** Measures local fluctuations or "noise" within the data.
* **$C(Ψ)$ (Global Inconsistency):** Measures large-scale contradictions or deviations from the global pattern.
* **$τ$ (Informational Time):** The discrete transitions between system states.
* **$S(Ψ)$ (Entropy):** The measure of uncertainty or disorder in the information flow.

## Project Objectives
1.  **Stability Mapping:** To calculate the point of absolute equilibrium where $I + C < 0.001$.
2.  **Quantum-to-Cosmic Bridge:** Mapping physical constants ($c, G, ħ, k_B$) into informational dynamics.
3.  **Predictive Evolution:** Forecasting the next $5τ$ states of a system to determine if it will stabilize or diverge.
4.  **Coherence Analysis:** Measuring how well a system maintains its structural integrity ($Coh$) over time.

## Technical Implementation
This repository contains:
* **Mobile Interface:** A React-based (JSX) dashboard for real-time SCID calculations.
* **Micro-to-Macro Engine:** An HTML5/JavaScript supercomputer interface with 8 live canvas engines for data visualization.
* **Physical Constants Integration:** Real-world physics values used to ground the informational theory in material reality.
